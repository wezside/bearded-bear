A simple stub application for OpenFrameworks and the Leap Motion SDK on Ubuntu. It is assumed that you have OF set up on your machine.

Setup
====

# Register as a [Leap Motion dev](https://developer.leapmotion.com/) and download the latest SDK
# Open the header file LeapMath.h and replace the preprocessor directives PI, DEG_TO_RAD, RAD_TO_DEG  with these:

	...

	/** The constant pi as a single precision floating point number. */
	#ifndef PI
	static const float PI          = 3.1415926536f;
	#endif
	/**
	 * The constant ratio to convert an angle measure from degrees to radians.
	 * Multiply a value in degrees by this constant to convert to radians.
	 */
	#ifndef DEG_TO_RAD
	static const float DEG_TO_RAD  = 0.0174532925f;
	#endif
	/**
	 * The constant ratio to convert an angle measure from radians to degrees.
	 * Multiply a value in radians by this constant to convert to degrees.
	 */
	#ifndef RAD_TO_DEG
	static const float RAD_TO_DEG  = 57.295779513f;
	#endif

	...

# Generate a new OF project using the project generator
# Copy libLeap.so shared libary to your PROJECT_ROOT/libs folder (if the folder doesn't exist create it)
# Add the following to your config.make

		USER_LIBS = -lLeap
		USER_LDFLAGS = -L./libs

# Make/Compile and run application
